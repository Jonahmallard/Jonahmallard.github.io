Well, most importantly you need to be prepared for a lot of work in a relatively short amount of time. I spent about six weeks before starting this program trying to learn everything i could about Programming/Software Development. I applied to a few different schools, thumbed through their prep work, watched videos, and asked around about anything i should know about. But in the first two weeks at Flatiron we went pretty in depth on a lot of very important concepts. Another important thing about First Mile is getting to participate in your first online classroom Study Groups. These are fun and really great for setting your epectations on what the coming months or year is going to be like. Of course is does slow down a little bit after First Mile, but there's still enought work to keep you busy.
