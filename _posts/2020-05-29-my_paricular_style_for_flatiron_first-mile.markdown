I studied a ton, before getting accepted in to Flatiron School. I spent countless hours studying everything from HTML & CSS to making 3D games with C# in Unity. But, First-Mile focused mainly on Ruby. Which, for the most part was not the language i was studying the most. We went in-depth on concepts i had only heard about briefly. I thought this was really great because i felt like i was finally learning a Programming Language hands on. It got tense pretty fast, and it was a lot more challenging than I had initially anticipated. Once I starting to get the hang of it, finishing tests, working through labs, and reading all the material. I spent at least 15 minutes working on my own trying to get as far as I could. Then I would search Google for the specific method or concept with which I was struggling. And when all else failed I would use the Ask A Question button, which paired me with an instructor in no time and almost always got me through the rest of my tests on any given lab. My cohort mates also hosted student led Study Groups that were very helpful. While attending all the scheduled Lectures and Open Office Hours with my cohort lead i was able to finish First-Mile.
