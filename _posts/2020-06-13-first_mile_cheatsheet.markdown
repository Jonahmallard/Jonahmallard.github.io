First of all, Ruby needs to be your bestfriend. Attend all the meetings or at least watch the recordings in order. Make sure to follow along closely, it's very important not to miss any of the Assingments with critical due dates. If you follow certain guidlines and apply a decent amount of effort you will learn a lot about Ruby as a Programming Language.

Everything sort of ramps up, but it starts off steady enough. I sort of spent several days watching JavaScript video 
walkthroughs. Understanding the language from the front to as far back as i could go. First Mile really did the same thing over two weeks. This time with Ruby as the main Programming Language. 

Make sure to open up terminal and write whatever you consider to be a sufficient amount of code. Follow along with 
the rest of the cohort and you will have more to write in a relatively short amount of time. Write Code every day for 30 minutes at least.

These guidlines require you to start off on your own. Open up all the files, and do some digging. Once you feel like you have a thorough understanding of the documents you need to start working through some tests. When you feel like you've reached a stopping point or a rough patch feel free to express your resources i.e. google, the "Ask a Question" button, and even your cohort mates. Don't be afraid to reach out whenever you get stuck.
