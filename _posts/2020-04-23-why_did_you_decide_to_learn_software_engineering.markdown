Well, I only recently discovered Coding Bootcamps in the last few months. My Uncle just finished a Full Stack Web Development Program at Nashville Software School last year and was able to get a high paying job shortly after. He told me a little bit about Html, but that went mostly over my head until I started looking into it more seriously. The first thing I did that sort of sparked my interest in wanting to learn more was signing up for a Crash Course on Html and CSS on Thinkful. After that I kept discovering more great resources for free on many different websites. I've spent countless hours over the last few months soaking up everything I can. Flatiron has proven to be the most consistently efficient in the business and I really appreciate that. I find their study materials and IDE method to be very effective and user friendly.
